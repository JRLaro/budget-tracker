## _Description_

This application assist the user by tracking their budget. With the easy to use functionality, all the user has to do is enter the name of their transaction - as well as the amount. Then buy clicking "add funds" will result in an increase to their total or "subtract" which will decrease the total. A dynamic graph measures their transactions as well displays all previous transactions. 

In the event that the user loses internet connection - FEAR NOT - their data is safely stored inside IndexedDB pending, once the user is reconnected the pending data is extracted from IndexedDB.
